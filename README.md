# CAs:

The **CAs** (Class Assignments) are sets of practical problems designed to test and enhance students' understanding of various data structure concepts covered in the course. Here's a breakdown of the CAs based on the files you uploaded:

### **CA1: Data Structures Basics & String Manipulation**

This assignment focuses on problems involving basic data structures such as arrays and string manipulation. The challenges often require implementing efficient algorithms to manipulate and process data in various forms. Example problems include:

- **Palindrome Detection**: Implement algorithms to identify substrings that form palindromes.
- **AM/PM Time Manipulation**: A problem that deals with converting and manipulating time in 12-hour format.

Key skills tested:

- String manipulation techniques.
- Array traversal and modification.
- Basic problem-solving using loops and conditionals.

### **CA2: Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks**

In this CA, you are tasked with implementing core data structures from scratch, such as:

- **Queues**: Creating a queue with functions like `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and checking if it's empty.
- **Stacks**: Implementing stacks with standard operations such as `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.
- **Linked Lists**: Inserting elements at both the front and end, as well as reversing a linked list.

This CA is essential for understanding how to work with dynamic data structures where elements are connected via pointers or references, and it provides an opportunity to implement abstract data types (ADTs) from the ground up.

Key skills tested:

- Understanding of dynamic memory allocation.

- **Huffman Tree**: A tree structure used in compression algorithms, where you implement tree-building and encoding operations.
- **Binary Search Trees**: Implementing BST operations like insertion and inorder traversal.

These problems are designed to give students a deeper understanding of tree structures and their applications in searching, sorting, and compression algorithms.

Key skills tested:

- Recursive tree traversal techniques.

### **CA4: Graph Theory and Special Algorithms**

This assignment involves more complex problems, primarily focusing on graph algorithms and special cases:

- **Graph Coloring / Bipartitioning**: A problem where you have to split nodes into two teams while avoiding certain conflicts (edges in the graph representing "enemies").
- **Tree Traversal and Manipulation**: Several problems are based on trees where you must traverse or manipulate nodes under specific constraints.
- **Advanced Sorting and Rearranging**: Some problems focus on rearranging elements (like a bookshelf of dictionaries) using unconventional methods (like reversing subarrays).

These problems are aimed at developing your skills in graph theory, including understanding graph traversal (BFS, DFS), as well as learning advanced sorting and optimization techniques.
